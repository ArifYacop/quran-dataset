56,2,49,"And [remember] when We saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who were inflicting dreadful torment upon you: slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. That was a great trial from your Lord.",""
57,2,50,"And [remember] when We parted the sea for you and saved you, while We drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.",""
58,2,51,"And [remember] when We appointed for Moses forty nights. Then you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers.",""
59,2,52,"Yet We pardoned you after that, so that you may be grateful.",""
60,2,53,"And [remember] when We gave Moses the Scripture and the criterion, so that you may be guided.",""
61,2,54,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves [the guilty among you]; that is best for you with your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance, for He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",""
62,2,55,"And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah openly,” but a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.",""
63,2,56,"Then We raised you back to life after your death, so that you may be grateful.",""
64,2,57,"And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” They did not wrong Us, but they wronged themselves.",""
65,2,58,"And [remember] when We said, “Enter this town [of Jerusalem] and eat freely from wherever you wish, and enter the gate bowing down humbly and say, ‘Absolve us.’ We will forgive you your sins and increase [the reward of] those who do good.”",""
66,2,59,"But the wrongdoers changed the words to other than what they were told; so We sent down upon the wrongdoers a torment from the heaven for their rebelliousness.",""
67,2,60,"And [remember] when Moses asked for water for his people, and We said, “Strike the rock with your staff,” Then twelve springs gushed forth from it; each tribe knew its drinking place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s provision, and do not spread corruption in the land.”",""
68,2,61,"And [remember] when you said, “O Moses, we cannot bear the same meal. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from what the earth produces – its herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.” Moses said, “Would you exchange what is better for what is inferior? Go down to any town and you will have what you have asked for.” They were struck with humiliation and destitution, and incurred the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to reject the signs of Allah and kill the prophets unjustly. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors.",""
69,2,62,"The believers and those who were Jews, Christians, and the Sabians [before Muhammad] – whoever believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteous deed, they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",""
70,2,63,"And [remember] when We took your covenant [O Children of Israel] and raised above you the mountain [saying], “Hold firmly to what We have given you and observe its teachings, so that you may become righteous.”",""
71,2,64,"But then you turned away after that. If it had not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, you would have surely been among the losers.",""
72,2,65,"And you know about those among you who broke the Sabbath, whereupon We said to them, “Be apes, despised.”",""
73,2,66,"So We made it a deterrent punishment for those alive and for those who succeeded them, and an admonition for the righteous.",""
74,2,67,"And [remember] when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.” They said, “Are you mocking us?” Moses said, “I seek refuge in Allah from being so ignorant!”",""
75,2,68,"They said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what [type of cow] it is.” He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow that is neither too old nor too young, but somewhere in between. So do as you are commanded!’”",""
76,2,69,"They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us its color.” He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a yellow cow, bright in color – pleasing to the beholders.’”",""
77,2,70,"They again said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. All cows look alike to us. If Allah wills, we will surely be guided.”",""
78,2,71,"He said, “Allah says, ‘It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor water the field; sound, without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Then they slaughtered it, yet they were hesitant.",""
79,2,72,"And [remember] when you [Israelites] slew a man and disputed as to who the killer was, but Allah exposed what you were concealing.",""
80,2,73,"We said, “Strike the slain with a piece of it.” This is how Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, so that you may understand.",""
81,2,74,"Then your hearts became hardened after that, like rocks or even harder. There are rocks from which rivers gush forth, and there are others that split open from which water comes out, while others fall down out of humility to Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.",""
82,2,75,"Do you [O believers] hope that they would respond to your call to believe, while a party of them used to hear the word of Allah then distort it knowingly after understanding it?",""
83,2,76,"And when they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when they meet one another in private they say, “Are you telling them what Allah has revealed to you [about Mohammad], so that they may argue against you before your Lord? Have you no sense?”",""
84,2,77,"Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?",""
85,2,78,"And among them there are illiterate people, who know nothing of the Scripture except wishful thinking, and they do nothing but guesswork.",""
86,2,79,"So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Allah,” in order to trade it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.",""
87,2,80,"And they say, “The Fire will never touch us except for a few days.” Say, “Have you taken a covenant from Allah; for Allah will never break His covenant, or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?”",""
88,2,81,"No indeed! Those who do evil and are surrounded by their sins – they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever.",""
89,2,82,"But those who believe and do righteous deeds – they are the people of Paradise; they will abide therein forever.",""
90,2,83,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, “Do not worship except Allah; be kind to parents and kindred, and to orphans and those in need; speak good words to people; establish prayer; and give Zakah.” But then you turned away paying no heed, except a few of you.",""
91,2,84,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from you that you should neither shed blood of one another, nor expel one another from your homes. Then you acknowledged it, and you bear witness to it.",""
92,2,85,"Then here you are, killing one another and expelling a group of your people from their homes, aiding one another against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. Do you then believe in part of the Scripture and deny another part? Then what is the recompense for those who do so among you except disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be subjected to the severest torment? For Allah is not unaware of what you do.",""
93,2,86,"These are the people who have purchased the life of this world for the Hereafter; their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.",""
94,2,87,"We gave Moses the Scripture and sent a succession of messengers after him. We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you [O Israelites] with something against your desires, you become arrogant; some of them you rejected, and others you killed?",""
95,2,88,"They say, “Our hearts are wrapped.” Nay, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, little is it that they believe.",""
96,2,89,"Now that there has come to them a Book from Allah, confirming that which is with them – although they used to pray for victory over the disbelievers in the past. But when there came to them what they recognize [to be true], they rejected it. May the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers!",""
97,2,90,"How miserable is the price for which they sold their souls – disbelieving in Allah’s revelation out of jealous hatred that Allah would send down His grace to whom He wills of His slaves. Thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath, and for the disbelievers there will be a disgracing punishment.",""
98,2,91,"When it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has sent down,” they say, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, although it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, “Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you were truly believers?”",""
99,2,92,"Moses came to you with clear signs, yet you took the calf [for worship] in his absence, while you were wrongdoers.",""
100,2,93,"And [remember] when We took a covenant from you and We raised above you the mountain [saying], “Hold firmly to what We have given you and obey,” they said, “We hear and disobey.” The love of [worshiping] the calf was engraved in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, “How wretched is what your faith enjoins you, if you are believers!”",""
101,2,94,"Say, “If the Home of the Hereafter with Allah is only for you [O Israelites] among all humans, then wish for death if you are truthful.”",""
102,2,95,"But they will never wish for that because of what their hand have sent forth. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers.",""
103,2,96,"And you will surely find them the most greedy people for life, even more than the polytheists. Each one of them wishes to have a life of a thousand years. Even if they were granted such a long life, it would not save them from the punishment; for Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",""
104,2,97,"Say [O Prophet], “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel – it is he who brings down this [Qur’an] to your heart by Allah’s permission, confirming what came before it, and a guidance and glad tiding for the believers.”",""
105,2,98,"Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, and to Gabriel and Michael – then Allah is indeed an enemy to the disbelievers.",""
106,2,99,"We have sent down to you clear proofs, and none will reject them except the evildoers.",""
107,2,100,"Is it that every time they ratify a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.",""
108,2,101,"And when a messenger from Allah came to them – confirming what was with them, a party of the People of the Book cast Allah’s Scripture behind their backs as if they did not know.",""
109,2,102,"They followed what was recited by the devils during the kingdom of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels Hārūt and Mārūt in Babylon. But these two angels did not teach anyone without telling them, “We are only a test, so do not disbelieve.” Yet they would learn from them what would cause separation between a man and his wife. But they could not harm anyone except by Allah’s permission. They learn what harmed them and did not benefit them, although they already knew that whoever gets into it would not have any share in the Hereafter. How terrible was the price for which they sold themselves, if only they knew!",""
110,2,103,"If only they had believed and feared Allah, they would have a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!",""
111,2,104,"O you who believe, do not say, “Rā‘inā.” [consider our situation!] But say, “Unzhurnā,” [wait for us!] and listen. And for the disbelievers there will be a painful torment.",""
112,2,105,"Neither those who disbelieved from the People of the Book nor the polytheists wish that your Lord sends down any good to you [O Muslims]. But Allah chooses for His mercy whom He wills, for Allah is the possessor of great bounty.",""
113,2,106,"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring a better one or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of all things?",""
114,2,107,"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth, and that you have no protector or supporter besides Allah?",""
115,2,108,"Or would you like to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has indeed strayed from the sound path.",""
116,2,109,"Many of the people of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of the envy in their hearts, after the truth has become evident to them. But pardon and overlook until Allah passes His decree, for Allah is Most Capable of all things.",""
117,2,110,"And establish prayer and give zakah. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, for Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",""
118,2,111,"And they say, “None will enter Paradise except a Jew or a Christian.” That is their wishful thinking. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.”",""
119,2,112,"On the contrary, whoever submits himself to Allah and is a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. They will have no fear, nor will they grieve.",""
120,2,113,"The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on,” although they both recite the Scripture. And those [pagans] who have no knowledge say something similar. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.",""
121,2,114,"Who does greater wrong than the one who prevents Allah’s name to be mentioned in His mosques and strives for their destruction? Such people do not deserve to enter them except in fear. There is a disgrace for them in this world and a great punishment in the Hereafter.",""
122,2,115,"To Allah belong the east and the west; wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah. For Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.",""
123,2,116,"They say, “Allah has taken a son.” Glory be to Him! Rather, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and earth – all are devoutly obedient to Him.",""
124,2,117,"The Originator of the heavens and earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.",""
125,2,118,"Those who have no knowledge say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign be given to us.” Those who came before them said similar words. Their hearts are all alike. We have made the signs clear to people who have sure faith.",""
126,2,119,"We have sent you with the truth [O Prophet] as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the people of the Blazing Fire.",""
127,2,120,"The Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion. Say, “The guidance of Allah is the [true] guidance.” If you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would have no protector or helper against Allah.",""
128,2,121,"Those to whom We have given the Book recite it as it should be recited, it is they who believe in it. As for those who disbelieve in it, it is they who are the losers.",""
129,2,122,"O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you over all other people.",""
130,2,123,"And beware of the Day when no one will avail another in any way; no compensation will be accepted, and no intercession will benefit it, nor will they be helped.",""
131,2,124,"And [remember] when Abraham was tested by his Lord with certain words, which he fulfilled. Allah said, “I will make you a leader for mankind.” He said, “And from among my descendants?” Allah said, “My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.”",""
132,2,125,"And [remember] when We made the House [Ka‘ba] a focal point and a sanctuary for the people. “[O believers], take the Station of Abraham as a place for prayer.” We charged Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who perform circumambulation or stay for worship, or those who bow down and prostrate.",""
133,2,126,"And [remember] when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city [of Makkah] a sanctuary and provide its people with fruits – those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” [Allah] said, “As for those who disbelieve, I will grant them enjoyment for a short while, then I will force them into the punishment of the Fire. What a terrible destination!”",""

139,2,132,"This was enjoined by Abraham and Jacob to their offspring, “O my children, Allah has chosen for you this religion; so do not die except as Muslims.”",""
140,2,133,"Or were you present when death approached Jacob, when he said to his children, “What will you worship after me”? They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers – Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac – the One God. And to Him we submit.”",""
141,2,134,"That was a nation which has passed; they will have what they earned and you will have what you earned, and you will not be questioned concerning what they used to do.",""
142,2,135,"They say, “Be Jews or Christians to be guided.” Say, “Rather the religion of Abraham, the monotheist, and he was not one of the polytheists.”",""

We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted.”",""
144,2,137,"If they believe as you have believed, then they are guided. But if they turn away, then they are in plain dissension. Allah will suffice you against them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",""
145,2,138,"This is the natural religion of Allah. Who is better than Allah in [enjoining a] religion? And it is He Whom we worship.",""
146,2,139,"Say, “Do you [People of the Book] argue with us concerning Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord? We are responsible for our deeds and you for yours, and we are sincerely devoted to Him.",""
147,2,140,"Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the descendants [of Jacob] were Jews or Christians?” Say, “Are you more knowledgeable or Allah?” Who does greater wrong than the one who hides a testimony he has from Allah? But Allah is not unaware of what you do.",""
